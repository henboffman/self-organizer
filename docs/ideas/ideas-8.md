# Ideas 8

1. The tags and entities page takes a long time to load every time it is accessed. it should always be quick, but the second and later reloads during the same session should be instant. it appears to reinitialize on each load.
2. When i use the #tags inside the title or description, the text is removed, leaving incomplete sentences and strange gaps. It should not remove any text from any of the fields on creation, but instead search them for the the presence of tags, and add those tags without destroying the original data. The #tags should also render uniquely when viewing the tasks/projects/goals in read only mode, perhaps with styling that indicates they can be clicked to view that tag.
3. I do not like the font- it looks and feels childish and unprofessional. Can we please use helvetica or something clean and professional looking. probably helvetica or something similar.
4. If i associate a goal with a project, and that goal has tasks, the project should then use those tasks when checking for the next project action`
5. The user should be able to create new tasks on the fly from the project or goal page (in addition to attaching existing)

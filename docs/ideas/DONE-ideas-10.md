# Ideas 10

1. I want to introduce a new feature where the user can use natural language commands to interact with the application. We already have a number of methods exposed due to the command pattern throughout the application. We also have entity extraction running in the background doing some degree of semantic tagging. Ideally, we could implement this feature without depending on an LLM, but we're currently running this as a WASM app and I've already started to notice areas of concern (the tag generation takes 20 seconds), so i'm not sure how far we can get. Regardless, the final functionality needs to be a text interface where the user can enter their desire, and as well as we're able, the application executes that command. Start with all the basic commands that we already have exposed, those should be easy. I think where we'll be challenged is in the user asking to see some type of data with some type of filter or grouping applied "e.g. show me my tasks from last month, show me my tasks i did this week, etc..". To accommodate this, prepare a generic search interface capable of rendering a combination of entities from the application. we already have this built out in the search via the cmd-shift-space interface, so we can leverage that into a standalone search interface. we should also, to the best of our ability, provide facets/filters in the search results which allow the user to refine the results. for this, we need to be aware of the common properties or connecting relationships. To test, lets see that the app can handle the user creating tasks, asking about a task relating to xyz (need substring search on database entities, I think), asking for everything related to something. come up with a few other potential requests to use as tests. in the results, the user might want to export the results, so provide that as well. if it helps, you can treat this as the precursor to implementing an MCP server for the application. The natural language input should be accessible on the dashboard, and via the navbar anywhere in the app. Please use the techniques in /Users/benjaminhoffman/Documents/code/self-organizer/.claude/claude.md to plan out all requirements, potential tasks, features, etc.. And please consider similar functionality as it might exist in other applications, to use as inspiration. our goal is maximizing the users comfort and ability to use the application, and the applications ability to serve the needs of the user. If needed, leverage our LLM service for this functionality. and if any packages or frameworks are added, please make sure that they are completely open source and completely free for use in enterprise.
2. We need to subtly introduce the database functionality. I think we started on this previously, but to recap- because we're now releasing this to more users than myself, users require the safety and reassurance that their data wont disappear, which is a possibility given that we're using IndexDB to store things. So, I want the application update to be seamless, and as it detects data in indexdb, it begins syncing it over to the database. i want the application to be brainless for users to use.
3. We're also going to need to introduce the concept of authenticating users to the application in the deployed version. For that, we'll be using Entra. And while we're at it, we should probably finish implementing the outlook calendar sync integration to the best of our ability. So please work on that, and the use of Entra should be a feature toggle for us. If it is enabled, it should authenticate the user immediately on load, as they'll begin entering/saving user preferences once they interact with the new user onboarding dialog.
4. In the new user onboarding dialog, there are pages which are information, and pages which are interactive (selecting the life balance parameters). They appear visually similar, however the non-interactive screens are displayed before the interactive ones, but by the time the interactive pages are displayed, the user has been conditioned that they don't click on those dialog elements. please adjust the onboarding dialog to make it clearer when the content is interactive and when it isn't.
5. please make sure that there are no hardcoded paths or anything referenced in the application. we shouldnt see the /documents/code/self-organizer path anywhere in the app.

# Ideas 9

- [ ] Need to implement stale task reminders/revisitor. The user should probably be able to configure their preferences for this setting.
- [ ] Need to update the summary exports (html, markdown) to match the current summary screen (many updates have been added)
- [ ] It’d be nice if users could extend a task that is running in the timer- maybe they found out it’s going to take longer than they estimated. A few things to unpack with this. I think there might be value in tracking the estimated versus actual. I’m also not sure if it’s a good thing for the user to extend their tasks. It is a fact of reality that tasks take longer than we estimate sometimes. But perhaps the user should create a second task instead. Although they probably just want to keep working on it at that time, in which case preserving that task and extending the time it makes sense.
- [ ] It would also be nice if users could choose to work on more than one task at a time when using the focus timer. For example, I was working on both the information release and the SDH application at the same time.
- [ ] We could create puppeteer tests that verify each of the settings and toggles apply/ change what they should
- [ ] Start building the logic and app for the organizational overview functionality. Goal adoption is a good first test
- [ ] Need to add way for clients to push data up to the organization. Now that we’re using SQL server instead of indexdb, and we’re going to release it as an app, we could just have organizations built in to the system, and then the deployment handles the alignment. Although setting the organization on the user side would promote horizontal movement for users
- [ ] I don’t feel like the contexts are very intuitive and I always feel uncomfortable using them. We should revise the way we’re handing contexts and try to make it a user friendlier experience

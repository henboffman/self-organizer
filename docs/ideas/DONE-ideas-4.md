# Ideas 4

0. We're going to connect the application to ollama and integrate an LLM service. the service will be used by multiple entities/services in the application, so it should be somewhat genericized, and then each consumer can manage their detailed implementation. Please add the necessary services into the application to prepare the ollama service
1. Allow users to capture their goals in the application. Let them set the window of time or deadline for the goal, and provide helpful fields to help them think pragmatically about how they achieve the goal. From there, it would be nice if the service could decompose the goal into subtasks, but this would only be possible if the application was connected to a local LLM. i'm running ollama locally, so lets add this functionality.
2. There should be three mechanisms to enter goals in the app- bulk import, manual entry, and AI-assisted entry. the AI-assisted entry should leverage ollama and act almost like a chat service with the user to help them think about their goals and break them down into smaller actionable parts
3. If the user bulk imported or manually entered their goals, they should be able to later use the LLM service to augment the goals. Please generate all the necessary prompt templates and data structures for these interactions and to ensure that we're always getting the necessary data format back from the model
4. The application should continue to function completely if Ollama is not available. simply inform the user that the app is not currently configured to use an LLM, and that they can set the connection information in the settings (maybe they're using azure openai or something). Ensure that everything besides the AI functionality continues to work if ollama isnt available
5. When the user changes the prep time or wind down time, use that as the value the next time the dialog is opened. it should always default to the previously used values
6. When the new event dialog opens, the title input should autofocus
7. The Create button should enable after the title has 3 or more characters, and not wait for the user to defocus the title input field before enabling the button
8. the user should be able to press cmd enter from the new event screen to create the event
9. if the user presses cmd shift space, it should display a search dialog like the one on mac os when the user presses cmd space. this search should allow the user to search all their tasks, events, and anything else, as a substring search, with matching results being displayed in the dialog (Same as the search panel in macos). the user should then be able to open any of the search results from the display, loading the relevant page. we have this functionality in /documents/code/ontology-builder/onto-editor/eidos application, if you want to reference it. it also uses the command pattern to enable undo and redo, which we should add to this application.
10. please add undo and redo functionality to the application leveraging the command pattern to make the code clean and reusable
11. When the user uses the auto scheduler, it should also consider the substasks for goals, the deadlines for the goals, progress towards the goals, and let the user know how they're doing towards their goals, and if they should prioritize work towards the goal to stay on track. Please feed the goals functionality in as well to the calendar and scheduling optimizer, and treat the subgoal actions as if they're tasks (we simply track which goal these tasks happen to be associated with (maybe they can have more than one associated))

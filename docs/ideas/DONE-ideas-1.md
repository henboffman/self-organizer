# Ideas 1

1. in the quick add/capture, allow the user to use # character to create tags, which are then added to the task tags field
2. We need to be able to add tags to events as well. the # should work in the event descriptions. The tags should be factored in to the scheduling/smart settings, treating the tags as if they are entities.
3. it doesnt appear to save my task scheduling settings. also, when we go to the calendar and i have it add tasks, it adds them to the start of the day, even if we're near the end of the work day. it should look for the next available time slot, and if we have smart settings, should factor those settings in when placing
4. the user should be able to quickly add blocks of time to the calendar- ideally with two clicks at most. they could click and drag on the calendar and then a radial menu appears where they select the type of work, focus, or session it is. the UI should be really juicy and nice, with brief animations/effects when showing and hiding the radial menu, hovering and clicking options, etc.
5. The tag functionality should be case-insensitive
6. When viewing something in view/read mode, if there are tags present in the text, it should apply special rendering to show that it is an entity, maybe hiding the # character and instead making it clear that it is a clickable element
7. When the user clicks a tag or entity, it should take them to a page that shows information about that tag, including all incoming or outgoing references. This would in turn serve as the wiki-type landing page for the tag
8. Please make sure the entity extraction is working. It should work retroactively as well, making sure that past tasks and events have been categorized effectively
9. dragging the tasks on the calendar no longer work (after we adjusted the click functionality being differentiated from the drag functionality)

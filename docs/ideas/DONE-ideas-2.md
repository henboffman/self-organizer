# Ideas 2

1. the sidebar is confusing, as there are so many options to click on, and some of them are very similar conceptually, so it's even more confusing (schedule vs calendar, for example).
2. I'm still not seeing the entity extraction applying tags to tasks or calendar events. Lets add an explicit button that I can click so that I know that it runs, and then show a small status message somewhere indicating when the last entity extraction run happened. it should generate them in real time as data is created/published to the database, but the retroactive scans can serve as extra review passes to ensure we constantly update our entities.
3. To ensure that the entity extraction is working, and that tags are factoring in (entities should manifest as tags added by the system), we should have a page that lets me see the entities in our data, and lets me click them to view their data, incoming and outgoing links, etc..
4. when creating projects, we should be able to add tags, either explicitly or using the # notation in the description or desired outcome fields. we should also have a URL field for the project, in case it's managed in github or azure devops, the user can link directly to the backlog.
5. as a principal developer, i have a lot of things going on concurrently. it would be nice if i could see groupings of my current apps im working on, documentation im writing, things im researching, lingering todos or automations. this might help with some of the scheduling or planning as well, for example, i could say "i want to dedicate today to xyz app" and it'd configure the calendar and rerun the smart scheduler to accommodate those changes. it also could use those as grouping anchors when planning the days/where tasks should be (group all things for a given project near each other, group all app related tasks near each other (as together as possible with respect to meetings), etc.)
6. In the calendar view, add a notification section that informs the user if there are small changes they can make which might enable large windows of focus on a single topic or work type. for example, if i have a 1:1 with someone on a day that otherwise could be dedicated entirely to a single project (based on meetings or tasks or whatever), then it should tell me "if you can move this meeting, you can unlock xyz hours for dedicating time to abc"

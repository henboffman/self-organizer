# Ideas 3

1. If the user has several meetings packed together, but those meetings require prep time or followup or decompression, warn the user that those associated times need to be moved and wont immediately precede/follow the meeting. Attempt to schedule them as close to the meeting as possible within reason (Do not overlap with meetings, rearrange low priority tasks as needed (while still factoring in the preferences/optimization for focus or context))
2. in the settings page, i feel that the schedule optimization section is now outdated, as we've added functionality and moved it elsewhere. please remove that.
3. the user should be able to define their own preferred contexts- i'll never choose the default options, and instead will add my own (thinks like think, do, email, read). I want to be able to select them from the edit task dialog. the user probably shouldnt be able to delete the initial ones, so maybe it shows the full list of their contexts, and sorts the most recently chosen options to the top.
4. The app should have some type of "Get Started" walkthrough that asks the users about the work that they do, their working preferences, etc., to build initial lists of tags, context options, slider options (if they prefer working in context blocks or work type blocks, etc..). Please dont make it too long- the user should be able to get through within 5 clicks/screens, and they should see the progress the entire time to know that they don't have to answer too much. it should be as simple as possible, and then let the user know that they can customize the settings later. We eventually want to provide the option to connect to Office 365 or google calendar, so we should probably ask the user when we ask these initial questions what they use (with an option for none) if they want to import meetings. The actual import can be added at a later time.
5. when the user imports meetings from google or outlook, those meetings should appear on the calendar, with rendering that makes it apparent what the source is. it should also attempt to bring over the category or categories, if they exist, and to treat those as tags. the user should be able to interact with the augmented meeting information (prep time, decompression time), but they cant edit the actual imported meeting. so we'll need to create a representation of the meeting so that we have the decompression time and prep time attached to a meeting.
6. the edge dragging still isnt working. when the user is within 8px of the edge (top or bottom) the icon should change to show the stretch icon, and then teh user should be able to drag. they shouldnt be able to go less than 15 minutes for duration.
